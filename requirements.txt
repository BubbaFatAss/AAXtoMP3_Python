# AAXtoMP3 Python Requirements
# This script relies on external tools rather than Python packages
# No additional Python packages are required beyond the standard library

# External dependencies (to be installed via system package manager):
# - ffmpeg (for audio conversion)
# - ffprobe (for metadata extraction, usually comes with ffmpeg)
# - mp4v2-utils (optional, for mp4art and mp4chaps - M4A/M4B files only)
# - mediainfo (optional, for additional metadata extraction)
